# Multi-Armed Bandit
Welcome to the MAB repository. The Multi-Armed Bandit problem is a classic example of decision-making under uncertainty, often encountered in reinforcement learning, optimization, and many other fields. This repo contains the theory and some implementations of various MAB algorithsm.

## Repository Structure

- `/algorithms` - Contains implementation of various MAB algorithms in Python.
- `/theory` - Includes theoretical explanations and derivations related to MAB problems and algorithms.
